The "Rename Media Files: Improve Your WordPress SEO" plugin will simplify the process of managing media file names (images, PDFs, etc) and metadata, ensuring a tidy and search engine-friendly media repository.

If you're an SEO guru and would like to make a better website for search engines by focusing on Image SEO, or someone who enjoys their files to be perfectly organized, this plugin will turn your dreams into reality.

The plugin comes with several features, like the ability to remove accents and special characters from filenames upon upload, rename files based on post titles, Site URL, or current date, and update file permalinks accordingly.

The Pro version goes much further, with features like manual filename and permalink editing, updating old media references in post content, and automatic alt tag generation, the possibilities for optimizing your media library are endless

## 🚀 Main Features: FREE Version##

### 🚀 Remove Accents & Special Characters from Filenames on Upload ###

Ensure clean and SEO-friendly filenames by automatically removing accents and special characters upon upload, this is very useful when you share these files on social media, so you have standard URL without non-friendly characters.

**Example 1:**
A file named "café.jpg" would be renamed to "cafe.jpg".

**Example 2:**
A file named "résumé.pdf" would be renamed to "resume.pdf".

### 🚀 Rename Media on Upload Based on The Site URL ###

Automatically rename uploaded files based on your site URL (domain name) to maintain consistency and relevance between your domain name, content, and media.

**Example 1:**
If your site URL is "example.com," and you uploaded an image named camera.jpg, you can automatically rename it to "example-com-camera.jpg".

**Example 2:**
You can append the site URL to other variables, like post name and/or file name, so for a site URL like "mywebsite.com" uploaded to a post named "how to create a site", a file might be renamed to "mywebsite-com-how-to-create-a-site.jpg".

### 🚀 Rename Media on Upload Based on Post Title ###

Automatically rename uploaded files based on the post title it was uploaded to, this helps in keeping your media & content aligned & consistent.

**Example 1:**
If you upload an image for a post titled "Exploring the Great Outdoors," the file could be renamed to "exploring-the-great-outdoors.jpg".

**Example 2:**
When images with identical names are uploaded to the same post, media name will be appended by a number, so in example 1 it will become "exploring-the-great-outdoors-1.jpg", and this can be customized as well.

### 🚀 Rename Media on Upload Based on The Current Date ###

Instead of the default categorization of media by WordPress (year & month), you can fully control what part of the date you want to include in your media names.

**Example 1:**
An image named "laptop-at-night.webp" uploaded on April 15, 2024, could be renamed to "laptop-at-night-2024-04-15.jpg".

**Example 2:**
You can go further and utilize other rules as well, so you can include site name, post title, file name, and finish it with a date, so you can have a file named "dog.jpg", uploaded to a post title "Nice Dogs", on a website named "Dogs for Life" and uploaded on May 28, 2024, the result file name could be "dogs-for-life-com-nice-dogs-dog-2024-05-28.jpg".

### 🚀 Update Media Permalink Based on Media Rename ###

Media file names might change, but permalinks don't (probably that's why they called so?), with this plugin you can maintain consistency between filenames and permalinks by automatically updating file permalinks based on media renaming actions.

### 🚀 Convert Filename Characters to Lowercase ###

Standardize all media & files characters on your website to lowercase for consistency, to ensure uniformity across your media library & reduce the risk of errors (if redirects weren't properly handled).

### 🚀 Advanced File Filtering Options ###

Customize file renaming behavior with advanced filtering options. Choose to ignore files with no extensions, specific file extensions, or filenames containing certain strings.

> “Does the trick!: We needed a plugin to change the file name of images being uploaded to our site to a 100% predicable URL based on post slug and custom fields. This super simple plugin does the trick! The developer is super responsive and helpful too. We’re glad to have got the pro version.” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [russs95](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/does-the-trick-86/)

> “Very handy: Install the plugin, check some simple settings, forget about it because the job will now be done. Thank you very much! 🙂” – ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ [wpguillaume](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/very-handy-210/)

### 🏆 Update Media Reference in post content on file renaming ###

Ensure a seamless integration between media files and post content with this option, so when a media file is renamed, this feature automatically updates all references to that file within post content and  prevents broken links or missing media elements in your website.

### 🏆 Rename (convert) Media Images Extension from JPEG to JPG ###

As "jpg" is the standard file extension for JPEG images, this feature automates converting images with  JPEG extension to the more widely recognized JPG format.
 
### 🏆 Update Filename on Post Update ###

Automatically synchronize media file names with post updates, so that you ensure media files remain aligned with their corresponding content.

### 🏆 Restrict Media File Renaming by User Role ###

Control access to media file renaming options & rules based on user roles of your website, so you guarantee that only authorized users have access to modification tools.

### 🏆 Restrict Media File Renaming by Custom Post Type ###

For those who want to have more control on media update based on the post type, the plugin allows media file renaming options to specific custom post types, such as: post, page, attachment, revision, nav_menu_item, product, product_variation, shop_order, shop_refund, and more!

### 🏆 Images SEO: ALT Texts & Media Titles Naming Automation ###

Take your Image SEO optimization to new levels by automatically generating ALT texts & images titles for images. 

When uploading media files, the plugin offers options to auto-fill both ALT text and image title based on predefined settings or the original filename. For example, if you upload an image named "sunset.jpg," the ALT tag and media title can be auto-filled with "Sunset Image," ensuring that both are descriptive and optimized for accessibility and search engine visibility.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What are the available options provided by this plugin? =

**For now, you can choose these options:**

* **Add Site url:** Inserts "yoursite.com" at the beggining of the file name. Ex: yoursite.com_filename.jpg. It is good for your SEO

* **Post title:** If you are on a post edit page called "Spiderman will leave Marvel" and you upload a jpg it will be called spiderman-will-leave-marvel-my-file.jpg. This option allows you to replace filename by post title or add the post title.

* **Remove characters:** Remove any characters you want from filename

* **Datetime:** You can add or replace filename by Datetime in any format you want

* **Lowercase:** Converts all characters to lowercase

* **Remove accents**

* **Update permalink:** When the filename is changed, you can also change its permalink if you want

= How does this plugin work? =
It renames files on upload using the available rules. More specifically, it uses some filters provided by WordPress to handle file name sanitizing, like **sanitize_file_name**, **sanitize_file_name_chars** or actions like **add_attachment**

= What are rules? =
Rules are options to control how your filename will be. Rules are enabled on the rules tab and have to be placed on the filename scructure option

= What is filename structure option for? =
It's the option where you can put your rules or any other characters you want to set how your filename will be

= Are there any hooks available?
* **frou_sanitize_file_name** Creates custom rules. Take a look on (Can I create a custom rule?)
* **frou_ignored_extensions** Ignores extensions. Take a look on (How to ignore extensions programmatically?)

= How to ignore extensions programmatically?
You can use the **'frou_ignored_extensions'** filter to ignore extensions programmatically.
For example, if you'd like to ignore txt, js and zip extensions:

`add_filter( 'frou_ignored_extensions', function ( $extensions ) {
	$extensions = array_merge( $extensions, array(
		'txt',
		'js',
		'zip',
	) );
	return $extensions;
} );`

= Can I create a custom rule?
Yes. It's easy.

First, you have to create a custom rule in the **filename structure** option using curly braces, like **{my_custom_rule}**. You just have to write it, in any position you want.

Now you can use the filter **frou_sanitize_file_name** to create a custom function. For example, if you want to put the user id it would be something like this:

`add_filter( 'frou_sanitize_file_name', function($filename_infs){
	$filename_infs['structure']['translation']['my_custom_rule'] = get_current_user_id();
	return $filename_infs;
}, 20 );`
