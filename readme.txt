== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= What are the available options provided by this plugin? =

**For now, you can choose these options:**

* **Add Site url:** Inserts "yoursite.com" at the beggining of the file name. Ex: yoursite.com_filename.jpg. It is good for your SEO

* **Post title:** If you are on a post edit page called "Spiderman will leave Marvel" and you upload a jpg it will be called spiderman-will-leave-marvel-my-file.jpg. This option allows you to replace filename by post title or add the post title.

* **Remove characters:** Remove any characters you want from filename

* **Datetime:** You can add or replace filename by Datetime in any format you want

* **Lowercase:** Converts all characters to lowercase

* **Remove accents**

* **Update permalink:** When the filename is changed, you can also change its permalink if you want

= How does this plugin work? =
It renames files on upload using the available rules. More specifically, it uses some filters provided by WordPress to handle file name sanitizing, like **sanitize_file_name**, **sanitize_file_name_chars** or actions like **add_attachment**

= What are rules? =
Rules are options to control how your filename will be. Rules are enabled on the rules tab and have to be placed on the filename scructure option

= What is filename structure option for? =
It's the option where you can put your rules or any other characters you want to set how your filename will be

= Are there any hooks available?
* **frou_sanitize_file_name** Creates custom rules. Take a look on (Can I create a custom rule?)
* **frou_ignored_extensions** Ignores extensions. Take a look on (How to ignore extensions programmatically?)

= How to ignore extensions programmatically?
You can use the **'frou_ignored_extensions'** filter to ignore extensions programmatically.
For example, if you'd like to ignore txt, js and zip extensions:

`add_filter( 'frou_ignored_extensions', function ( $extensions ) {
	$extensions = array_merge( $extensions, array(
		'txt',
		'js',
		'zip',
	) );
	return $extensions;
} );`

= Can I create a custom rule?
Yes. It's easy.

First, you have to create a custom rule in the **filename structure** option using curly braces, like **{my_custom_rule}**. You just have to write it, in any position you want.

Now you can use the filter **frou_sanitize_file_name** to create a custom function. For example, if you want to put the user id it would be something like this:

`add_filter( 'frou_sanitize_file_name', function($filename_infs){
	$filename_infs['structure']['translation']['my_custom_rule'] = get_current_user_id();
	return $filename_infs;
}, 20 );`
